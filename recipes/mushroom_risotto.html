    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 pound portobello mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 pound white mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 medium shallots, diced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups arborio rice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry wine</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped chives</li>
        <li>1/3 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>sea salt and freshly ground black peppers to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Warm broth in a saucepan over low heat. Meanwhile, warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add portobello and white mushrooms; cook and stir until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove mushrooms and their liquid to a bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the saucepan. Stir in shallots and cook for 1 minute. Add rice; cook and stir until rice is coated with oil and pale, golden in color, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in wine, stirring constantly until wine is fully absorbed. Add 1/2 cup warm broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed.</li>
        <li>Continue adding broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, yet firm to the bite, about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat. Stir in reserved mushrooms and their liquid, butter, chives, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
