    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 cups fresh strawberries</li>
        <li>1/3 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cold unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>3/4 cup half-and-half</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract, divided</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups whipped heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch cake pan with butter and lightly dust with flour.</li>
        <li>Slice the strawberries and toss them with 1/3 cup of white sugar. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, 1/4 cup of white sugar, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl; cut in butter with a pastry blender or two knives until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center of mixture; add beaten egg, half-and-half, and 1 teaspoon vanilla.  Stir mixture until just combined and no dry spots remain, being careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li>Spoon batter evenly into prepared cake pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean and top is golden brown, about 18 minutes. Let cool partially in cake pan, about 10 minutes. Flip cake onto a clean work surface.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, beat heavy cream, powdered sugar, and remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until soft peaks form, about 3 minutes. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Cut partially cooled cake in half horizontally, making 2 layers; set top layer aside. Drain reserved strawberries in a colander placed over a small bowl, reserving any juice. Brush strawberry juice evenly over top of bottom cake layer. Evenly arrange ½ of the drained strawberries over bottom layer of cake.</li>
        <li>Spread ½ of whipped cream evenly over strawberries; place top cake layer over whipped cream. Top with remaining strawberries and whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
